Very boring.  Very boring in the DR.  And it was quite nice having
breakfast with you early Sunday morning.

We had some excellent meetings in Santiago on Sunday/Monday and
discussed the situation in depth over dinner with the leading industrial
company on the island; Estrella (http://www.ingenieriaestrella.com/) and
a group of their strategic partners.  Estrella  is the largest
industrialist employer in the DR and is responsible for
development/co-development of much of the infrastructure in DR and
Haiti.  They are in infra construction, steel, asphalt, hospitals, media
(control largest newspapers, tv station, 4 radio stations, Major League
Baseball distribution, etc.  They have also been very involved in the
relief effort in Haiti and will continue to be.

We spoke to them about Matador, portfolio partner collaboration and a
number of ideas.  We have their ear, so as it relates to your
conversations today I would say we are in close to the key players there
and then hear them out as to what they are interested in doing to
contribute to the effort.

Anything else guys?

Hello guys, how was your trip back?.what a boring time we had in DR, so
glad that I am in the office again raining and 40 degrees outside  I am

that was interested in the Haiti's reconstruction (shareholder of
prointec). Did you guys got any information from your meetings regarding
this issue?. Please let me know. Best
