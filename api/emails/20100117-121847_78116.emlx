Beau,


I'm around all day for a call.


Given how this story in Massachusetts has developed over the last few days=
, I would recommend waiting until after Tuesday. Announcing your decision=
 -- or leaking it -- before Tuesday will not stop some people from saying=
 your decision was a political calculation. That is part of every story wr=
itten about every Democrat who has decided not to run for the Senate this=
 year. That is going to be true before or after Tuesday -- although less=
 of a story if by some chance Coakley pulls it out.=20


But, saying something at this point, I think it will hurt you. You will im=
mediately become inserted in the stories on Mass -- "More bad news for the=
 Democrats just hours before the polls open in Massachusetts". People will=
 ask "Why couldn't he have waited a day or two?". I know this may not seem=
 fair to you -- to somehow be caught up in the mess in Massachusetts -- bu=
t I think it's a real consideration -- and one that says you should wait=
 not because it's in Coakley's or the party's interests to do so -- but be=
cause it's in your best interests.


In my opinion the best push-back against this storyline is (a) the belief=
 in the Delaware press corps that the Bradley case has made it very diffic=
ult for you to run for the Senate and (b) what you say and how you look sa=
ying it when you get asked the question.


Again, around all afternoon to talk.


Thanks.


Mike
