 Hunter,
    Sorry this is late.  I asked Rob for your email address.
    I just wanted to drop you a note with regards to your grandmother's
passing.  ABC News ran a wonderful story on the 5:30 world news that night.
Your father's speech at the convention spoke incredible volumes of her
character.
    I was incredibly close to my mother's mother.  We actually lived with
her twice as a child.  I always say you can learn more from your
grandparents than your own parents most of the time.  Obviously I never met
your grandmother; but from what is told, they just don't make them like that
anymore.
    You are a very lucky fellow to have had her so late in your life.  Your
children got to also enjoy and learn from such a fine lady as well.
     Hope all is well.  Sure sorry for you loss,

Sincerely, Edward Hurley
