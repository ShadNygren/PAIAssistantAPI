The Office of Admissions and Financial Aid is excited to introduce the
new online re-enrollment process.  Your child's contract is now
available for completion and must be submitted by Monday, March 1, 2010.

To access, simply log in to the Parent Portal through the Sidwell
website and click on Re-Enrollment Contract link on the left. =20

After you have completed the contract, you will pay the deposit by
electronic payment from either a checking or savings account.  There are
easy to follow directions provided on the payment page. We are not able
to accept credit cards or paper checks.=20

If you have decided not to re-enroll your child for next year, please
log in as described above and click the appropriate box to indicate your
child will not be returning for 2010-11 academic year.

If you have any question, please call me at 202-537-2402 or send me an
email.  We will have a workstation set up in Admissions Office if you
feel you need assistance.
