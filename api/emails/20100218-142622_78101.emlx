Hunter,
  Haven't been able to catch up with you in a while. I don't think I have
spoken with you since mommom's passing and just want to say that I am really
sorry for your loss. She was a pretty incredible woman. I saw your aunt Val
last week at Jim Greene's going away party and you can tell where she gets
her spirit from...although some of it is certainly unaccounted for.

I also wanted to reach out and ask if you knew of anyone over at MPAA? I
applied for a press assistant job there last week (the description is copied
below).

It would be great to catch up next time you have a chance.
