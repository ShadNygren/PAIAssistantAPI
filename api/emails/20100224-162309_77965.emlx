Hunter -- =20

Tomorrow, the President will be hosting leaders from both parties at a =
bipartisan meeting about how to reform our broken health insurance system. =
It's a critical step toward getting the job done on health reform -- and a =
historic moment you won't want to miss.

Senators and representatives will gather with the President to talk =
through the bills that have already passed the House and Senate, as well =
as the proposal President Obama released on Monday. And they'll have an =
open discussion about any new ideas from either side of the aisle for how =
to solve this crisis.

OFA will live-stream the meeting starting at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. =
We'll provide live updates and feature video of key moments during and =
after the event.

Will you join us for this pivotal moment? Sign up and RSVP to get a =
reminder before the meeting starts, and then check in throughout the day =
tomorrow to see this historic conversation unfold:

http://my.barackobama.com/BipartisanRSVP

During tomorrow's meeting, the President will moderate a discussion on =
four critical goals:
   -- Protecting Americans from insurance company abuses;
   -- Reining in the cost of care;
   -- Putting affordable, high-quality coverage within reach of every =
American; and
   -- Reducing our unsustainable national deficit.

Tomorrow, the bottom line is simple: This issue is more important than any =
partisan divide. It's time to put all real solutions on the table, and =
it's time to move forward.

And this is your chance to be there when the long sprint toward health =
reform enters its final phase.

Please sign up for a reminder before the meeting starts, and then tune in =
for as much as you can starting at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time:

http://my.barackobama.com/BipartisanRSVP

Thanks,

Mitch
