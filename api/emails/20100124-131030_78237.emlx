Alex,

Jay Carney, Elizabeth and I were there with the VP.

Themal has this wrong -- the VP was talking about Ted Kaufman at this  
point of the interview, not Beau Biden.

It may not matter, given how close this is to Beau's announcement --  
but the VP was talking about how great a job Ted has done as Senator,  
how much respect Ted has for Themal, how Ted would need to be  
convinced to run since he has said he wouldn't.

This sounds to be like Themal and the VP were talking past each other  
-- with Themal thinking it was about Beau and the VP talking about  
Ted. But, if we check the tape -- and Elizabeth will -- I'm certain  
that it will be clear that Themal got it wrong.

</font>
</font></p><p><font face=3D"arial, helvetica" size=3D"2">In January 2009,
when Joe Biden said goodbye to the Senate where he had served for 36
years, he told his colleagues, "I will always be a Senate man. Except
for the title of 'father,' there is no title, including 'vice
president,' that I am more proud to wear than that of United States
senator."</font></p><p><font face=3D"arial, helvetica" size=3D"2">Now, one
year later, he is dismayed by what has happened to the Senate, and he
is trying to convince a reluctant son to run for his former seat.</font></=
p><p><font face=3D"arial, helvetica" size=3D"2">In
a wide-ranging interview last week about his first year as vice
president, Biden said a "lamentable atmosphere" exists in the Senate, a
view he says is shared by some of his long-time Republican friends.
Sixty votes are needed to pass almost anything to forestall a
filibuster, because the Republicans are unanimously saying no. How did
a deliberative constitutional body lose the basic principle that a
majority -- in the Senate's case, 51 votes -- doesn't count?</font></p><p>=
<font face=3D"arial, helvetica" size=3D"2">"I
have never seen one party [standing] the rules on their head like

from an NLRB nomination to health care, required 60 votes. No democracy
can long be sustained where you can only rule by supermajority."</font></p=
><p><font face=3D"arial, helvetica" size=3D"2">So
Biden has constitutional scholars researching whether and how such a
stalemate can be broken. As vice president, he presides over the Senate
he so loves and where he can cast the tie-breaking vote. "I never
thought we would get a genuine bipartisanship on health reform, but I
also didn't think people would vote against funding our troops in Iraq
and Afghanistan by directly voting against the defense appropriation
bill."</font></p><p><font face=3D"arial, helvetica" size=3D"2">Calling tha=
t
Senate stalemate the greatest disappointment of his first 12 months as
the nation's second-highest elected official, Biden said his two
greatest surprises have been "institutional constraints" and how he has
become an "impact player." The constraints he most chafes against are
the security arrangements required by his office, when "I got to have
28 Secret Service agents when I take off," and when he cannot easily
invite or circulate with the Delawareans who have long been his friends.</=
font></p><p><font face=3D"arial, helvetica" size=3D"2">He is pleased with=
 "how quickly I have been able to be an impact player in the implementatio=

<p><font face=3D"arial, helvetica" size=3D"2">We
spoke after he had just had his weekly one-on-one meeting with
President Obama in a small dining room off the Oval Office. Over his
tomato soup and a cheeseburger, they discussed personal matters but
concentrated on foreign concerns and domestic issues that each wanted
to bring up. It's obvious Obama and he have created an excellent
working relationship.</font></p><p><font face=3D"arial, helvetica" size=3D=
"2">Biden
has been the country's point man on Iraq, speaking frequently to its
leaders on the phone and inviting all parties to his Washington office,
and visiting the country now for the fourth time. He is concerned that
500 candidates have been disqualified for the coming election. As a New
York Times Magazine profile headlined in November, Biden "could be the
second-most-powerful vice president in history" as a "foreign policy
sage, sounding board, senatorial arm-twister, troubleshooter."</font></p><=
p><font face=3D"arial, helvetica" size=3D"2">According
to his office, Biden is projected to be the most-traveled vice
president ever, already having visited 14 countries and having met more
than 120 foreign officials in their countries and in Washington. The
office also compiled some other achievements for that first year: He
oversaw the White House Middle Class Task Force and the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act; raised funds for 33 candidates from 19
states; "was instrumental in Sen. Arlen Specter's switch to the
Democratic Party"; hosted more than 5,000 people (with wife Jill) at
their official home at the Naval Observatory and has made "fighting for
veterans and military families a major priority."</font></p><p><font face=
=3D"arial, helvetica" size=3D"2">Biden's
analysis of the Democrats' loss in Massachusetts was similar to
others'. The key problem for the Democrats may have been that the
Republicans campaigned against the health care bill in the only state
that already covers almost all of its citizens. He felt that Democrat
Martha Coakley "paid virtually no attention to the race, always a
disaster. ... I don't think the Republicans would have been ahead had
she hit the ground running." He also called the GOP winner, Scott
Brown, an "attractive personality, who came across as confident, was a

back.</font></p><p><font face=3D"arial, helvetica" size=3D"2">"As far as
the Democrats may be down in the polls, the Republicans are down
further," he pointed out. Even though both congressional parties are in
the 20s or 30s percentage-wise, both the president and the vice
president continue to rate in the 50s and 60s. To win in November, "we
have to focus on what's on people's immediate plate. If by November the
president is able to stand up and say, 'I kept my commitment,' and all
combat troops are out of Iraq, and we again have the beginnings of a
