Hello all,

Firstly, a correction from my previous e-mail about rowing waivers.  We =
do need to have waivers completed before the girls can PRACTICE on the =
water which, ice willing, may be fairly soon.  I think I may have left =
the impression that the waivers were for racing purposes only.=20

Now, yet another form to fill out.  The school requires that we submit =
permission forms for transportation of all athletes to events and =
practices outside of school.  You may already be familiar with this form =
from other team sports. We will need to have this paperwork submitted =
before the girls can make their first trip as a team, which will be to =
the training session in Chestertown on Saturday, February 27.  The link =
to the the form on Sidwell's website is:

http://www.sidwell.edu/data/files/gallery/AthleticsFileGallery/drivingper=
mission0910.pdf

We will also use these permission forms in our carpool arrangements.

At the moment,  we could use a few more parents who would be willing to =
drive some of our rowers to Chestertown.  Please let me know if you =
would be interested in helping out and I can begin to make a plan.

Thanks again for your patience,
Liz
