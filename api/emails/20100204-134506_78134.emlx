All,

I would like to inform you that I have accepted an appointment to become th=
e Deputy Executive Director of the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (=
GAIN).  GAIN is a public private partnership that promotes sustainable stra=
tegies to reduce malnutrition worldwide.  It operates in over 27 countries =
and has a target to reach a billion people with affordable, accessible and =
nutritious food.   www.gainhealth.org<http://www.gainhealth.org>

Building on my time at the Gates Foundation and previously the UN Foundatio=
n, I see this as an exciting opportunity to go deep on an issue that is imp=
ortant unto itself, as well as one that connects so many others, such as ma=
ternal and child health, infectious disease, food security, primary educati=
on, and obesity in both developing and developed countries.  There is an in=
creasing momentum at present in this area, with a clear opportunity for all=
 sector engagement.  In turn I hope to contribute to the various private, p=
ublic, policy and advocacy components that will be needed to ensure scaled =
and sustainable impact.

While GAIN is a Geneva based organization, for the time being I will be bas=
ed in Washington, to, among other responsibilities, help establish a U.S. s=
trategy and presence for GAIN.  I will remain at the Gates Foundation throu=
gh February and start work at GAIN in late March - over the next weeks I wi=
ll be implementing a transition of my work to others internally, and in tur=
n facilitating links to relevant external partners.

I have enjoyed my time at the Gates Foundation and am very glad that GAIN a=
nd Gates are such close partners.  I will look forward to working with you =
in the days ahead.

Best regards, Michael
