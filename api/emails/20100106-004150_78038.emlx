Wayne,

Its a pleasure to meet you, I hope you had an enjoyable new year and I
am sorry to hear about your partners passing. I believe Hunter passed on
materials relating to WeGov, I have attached some documents as well.
WeGov represents the most comprehensive open-member online political
platform and we are very excited to get it off the ground. =20
The document attached represents a convertible note offering of 300K,
just to let you know I am very flexible to different financing
alternatives. Our goal is to get WeGov launched by March and really hit
it for the 2010 election cycle. There are numerous things that I am
working on to enhance the platform further that are not included in this
document. Lets make sometime to chat in the next couple of days, I would
also like to come see you in Philadelphia in the next couple of weeks.

Best,

David
