Building&nbsp;a 30+ megawatt solar power farm on 100+ acres feeding in to the =
grid through the existing co-gen power plant on site.&nbsp; We believe we can =
bring 100% of the financing for this project (minimum $250m investment with 400 =
high-skilled jobs to design/build/tie-in to grid).&nbsp; It is critical to the =
project's economics that we are&nbsp;"substantially underway"&nbsp;by 12/31/10 =
for Treasury Department purposes to qualify us for the ARRA's ITC (Investment =
Tax Credit).&nbsp; This would be the largest solar power farm in the country, =
and it is possible to expand&nbsp;to make it the world's largest at 75 mw if =
you can help make the necessary land available. </SPAN></P>

Building a 150,000,000 gallon/year&nbsp;Green Diesel &amp; Green Jet =
Fuel&nbsp;refinery and distribution hub on the site.&nbsp; This plant would =
take advantage of bleeding-edge technology&nbsp;out of a&nbsp;Honeywell =
division which creates true hydrocarbon diesel molecules (not methyl =
esters)&nbsp;from any&nbsp;renewable feedstock.&nbsp;&nbsp;By taking advantage =
of&nbsp;the infrastructure, permitting, and power sources at the&nbsp;site, we =
believe that we can bring 2/3 of the capital necessary to&nbsp;complete the =
project.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our investment partners are willing to provide us =
with&nbsp;the $100m in operating capital&nbsp;to run the plant, but they are =
not in the business of funding the pre-conversion operations from petroleum =
diesel to Green Diesel.&nbsp; We&nbsp;believe we will need help securing =
the&nbsp;$40-50m necessary to convert/upgrade/relocate/purchase the necessary =
equipment.&nbsp; This $150m investment would create 100 immediate construction =
jobs, and would have 100 high-paying permanent jobs among trucking, logistics, =
maintenance, repairs, operations, and shipping.&nbsp; Obviously we would need =
to have a flagship corporate office there as well.</SPAN></P>

Building a pyrolysis oil refinery to feed renewable feedstocks into the =
existing co-gen power plant.&nbsp; We believe that there is an effectively =
infinite opportunity to bring to Delaware&nbsp;any organic feedstock, including =
all organic waste material that otherwise goes to dumps/landfills&nbsp;to =
convert it to bio-oil through a fast-pyrolysis process.&nbsp;&nbsp;We would =
build a&nbsp;bio-oil refinery to convert the feedstock and to connect&nbsp;it =
to the existing co-gen plant to burn it for&nbsp;electricity generation.&nbsp; =
This provides a very long-term opportunity for Delware to generate renewable =
electricity bounded only by the amount of bio-mass that can be brought to the =
site.&nbsp; The pyrolysis units are proven technology with a roughly $30m price =
tag for&nbsp;each 400 metric ton per day processor.&nbsp; While our company =
would seek to fund that project out of cash flows from the solar and/or Green =
Diesel projects, if another investor were willing to make earlier investments, =
we would be fully supportive either in addition or in substitution for our =
plans.</SPAN></P>

the two immediate project should create 500-700 jobs that would begin as soon =
as permitting is complete,&nbsp;and bring at least $400m in new investment to =
Delaware within 12 months.&nbsp; The third project would create dozens to =
hundreds of jobs depending on the number of pyrolysis units that were deployed =
there.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN style=3D"FONT-FAMILY: 'Tahoma','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">It is =
worth emphasizing that whatever the eventual outcome of the Blackstone =
negotiations, it would be a tragedy to allow this site to go from one dirty =
petroleum refinery to a new one without maximizing the job creation and clean =
tech&nbsp;value of the site.&nbsp; We believe that none of the clean tech plans =
