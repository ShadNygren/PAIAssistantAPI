Green Dry Cleaning
Avoid PERC (perchloroethylene a volatile organic compound - VOC). PERC is =
regulated, though not banned by OSHA and EPA and 85% US drycleaners still =
use it. If inhaled, PERC can affect the nervous and respiratory system =
(usually in occupational settings, but not always) and long-term exposure =
can damage the liver and kidneys. Studies link PERC to cancer in lab =
animals. PERC also contributes to smog when it reacts with VOCs in the =
air, all of which acts to damage the stratospheric ozone layer that =
protects us from the sun&rsquo;s harmful rays. Here&rsquo;s a few =
alternatives:
1. You can often hand-wash many dry clean only clothes=2E
2. &ldquo;Wet&rdquo; dry cleaning is safe and uses controlled amounts of =
water=2E
3. A new safe alternative, &ldquo;liquid CO2&rdquo;, converts CO2 to a =
liquid &amp; carries soap like water=2E
4. Avoid DF-2000, if possible, it&rsquo;s made from oil and thus, =
contributes to global warming=2E
5. Recycle those wire hangers!
