Hey-This whole thing (details I will share in person some day) just made
me so mad that I finally decided that I had to do something.  Just
wanted to let you know I sent this since I said I wasn't going to.  Hope
all is well.

Alan-Hope this finds you well.  It is hard to believe that it almost a
year since I saw you at Terry's party-I never imagined then that I would
still be the acting president of OPIC a year later!  When another
candidate was selected to be the nominee for this job, I had assumed
that because of my relationship with the VP and his support, all your
efforts on my behalf, and my service to the Obama administration running
the agency, the WH would at least place me on the list of possible
candidates for the position of  Vice President of External Affairs at
OPIC (a job I have also been doing for the past year).  Instead, the
nominee to head OPIC tells me that I can't be considered for this job
because the WH has told her that it must go to an Obama/Biden person and
they don't regard me as one.  Considering the VP's expressions of
support, your efforts and my service, it is really astounding to me that
I somehow don't qualify.  I was hoping that you might talk to Jim
Messina/Nancy Hogan about this and reaffirm the VP's interest and
support.  I know how busy you are and I have hesitated to bother you
with this.  But I know that if I am relegated back to the job I had
under the Bush administration it will certainly not go unnoticed by
those outside of OPIC who know of my association with the VP.

=20

Would appreciate if you could let me know if you get this e mail.  Let
me know if there is anything I can do on my end to resolve this issue.

Thanks for your help.
