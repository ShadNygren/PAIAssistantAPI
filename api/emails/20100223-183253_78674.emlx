Great news about John on both fronts.  Peru is great.  I actually
started surfing again (classes were a birthday present from Tracy) about
two months ago, and I've loved getting out there every week.  It's a lot
easier than surfing in Nicaragua.  Work is ridiculously busy.  I'm
running an office of about 130 people, and we keep growing.
Fortunately, the work remains interesting.  We're thinking about
building a "green" industrial park in the Amazon in one of the
coca-growing regions (my idea).  The unfortunate part of working for the
government is that I can't act on any business ideas I have in the
countries where I work.  Lots of missed opportunities in the DR and now
in Peru.
=20
It really is a great place to visit with family.  There's so much to do.
We just got back from a weekend in the South, visiting the second
deepest canyon in the world (twice as deep as the Grand Canyon) and
staying at a resort with volcanic hot springs.  Tracy and the kids are
loving it.
=20
I hope you're making progress toward your goal of not being a slave to
your mortgage.

What ever happened with John?  Did he ever get a job at Treasury?  How's
business these days?  My boss got called back up to Washington to head
USAID's Haiti Task Team (he's now USAID's top guy on Haiti recovery in
Washington).  Very impressive guy.  So, that means I'm Acting Director
of USAID in Peru for the indefinite future.  Scary.   =20
=20
I hope to be back in DC with the family for a week or two in July.
Maybe we can get together then. =20
=20
By the way, my grandmother ended up passing away two days after yours.
Unfortunately, I couldn't make it to the funeral.  It's tough being
away.
=20
Hope you and your family are doing well.  Come visit.

That's encouraging news.  I shared it with her, and she greatly
appreciated hearing that someone with the same thing is living a totally
normal life.  She said that she's happy so far with her doctors at
Cedars in L.A., but that she'll let me know if she wants any referrals
in the future.  Thanks so much.  Best to the family.

Yes that was his diagnosis. He is totally fine and has been ever since
he went through treatment 8 or 9 years ago now.  In favt it didn't
prevent him from joining Guard or passing any of the PT requirements for
active duty in Iraq. If you would like me to find names of his Dr.s I
can. He went to NIH.=20

Does that sound familiar?  Is my recollection correct that your brother
was diagnosed with what you described as "bamboo spine" a few years
back, but has since been living a pain free and normal life.  Or did he
have something else?  She's been going through months of unexplicable
pain until she finally hooked up with the right doctors in L.A. and is
about to start treatment.  She's got four kids under the age of seven.

	=20

	As for us, everything is going great in Peru.  I started my new
job, and I've been the Acting Mission Director since I got back and will
continue to be for the next month or so.  Nobody's tried to murder me
yet, which is a good sign.  We've been doing a lot of work advising the
Peruvian government on conflict mitigation in the wake of the indigenous
protests here a few months ago, so the work has been very interesting. =20

	=20

	I wish we had had more time to catch up while I was in D.C.  You
should plan a family trip to Machu Picchu.  Your kids are the perfect
age for that.

	=20

	If Ankylosing Spondylitis sounds familiar to you, let me know.
I'd love to be able to give my sister-in-law some hope that it's
something that she can live a normal life with when detected early.
She's been going through a very rough few months.
