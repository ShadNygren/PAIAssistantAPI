The Democratic Party
-----------------------
Robert -- =20

"A million dollars is not a lot of money." That's what RNC Chairman =
Michael Steele thinks, anyway.

To most Americans, that's crazy talk. But it's no surprise coming from the =
head of a party that prefers favors for Wall Street to jobs on Main =
Street.

How long would it take you to earn $1 million? Click here to find out -- =
then write a letter to the editor exposing the GOP's agenda.

http://my.democrats.org/MillionGOP

The average American household makes $52,000 per year. Only 2% make more =
than $250,000 -- and millions are out of work in a recovering economy.

But while arguing to extend the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy last =
Thursday at the University of Arkansas, Steele let slip that he thinks a =
million is "not a lot." It's outrageous -- but sadly, not surprising.

Greed and excess on Wall Street nearly brought down our economy, health =
care costs are drowning families, but the GOP is fighting to protect big =
banks and block health reform while proposing more and more tax cuts for =
the rich.

What's worse, the leading Republican on the House Budget Committee just =
proposed a budget that privatizes Social Security and shreds Medicare -- =
two programs that millions of middle-class Americans rely upon.

Republicans are going all out to be seen as defenders of the "little guy" =
this election season. But Chairman Steele's comment last week made it =
clear they're not. We need to make sure every American hears about it.

Use our calculator to figure out how long it would take you to earn "not a =
lot of money" -- then use our easy letter-to-the-editor tool, your own =
story, and our helpful tips to expose the GOP on the widely-read letters =
page of your local paper:

Thanks,

Governor Tim Kaine
