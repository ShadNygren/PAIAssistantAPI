Dear Eric,  I was wondering if you think your company might be interested i=
n looking at Negawatt.  We had a meeting with them in our Silicon Valley of=
fice yesterday and I thought I might forward you their white paper (attache=
d).  FYI, I was introduced to Negawatt by Dan Holley who is a former DARPA =
person who I have know for several years.  Dan will be leaving his professo=
rship at San Jose State this summer and he is considering joining Negawatt.=
  Please let me know at your convenience.  Thanks.  George
