Dear Hunter and Kathleen,  Two different people have asked me for your cont=
act info and I wanted to get your okay before I respond.

The first is Jon Mudd (Dan's Mudd brother) who wants your home address to s=
end you a sympathy card.

The second is John Mott--our neighbor who is a DC Superior Court judge and =
is on the list at the White House for a DC federal court judgeship.  He wou=
ld like Hunter's email.

Okay to provide?  Thanks.  George
