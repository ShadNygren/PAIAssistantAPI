Patrick-



Good seeing you this morning.  I am cc:ing Alex Snyder-Mackler on this emai=
l
to introduce you to him.  Alex has volunteered to do all the work so you an=
d
I are completely off the hook.  Seriously, though, Alex and the vast
campaign staff can deal with sending out the emails, getting RSVPs, helping
with logistics, etc. for the event.



Attached is an edited version of the spreadsheet that I had for the two Bea=
u
events four years ago. One was the =93Biden Alumni=94 Event and one was the
=93Friends of Beau=94 event at Patrick=92s house.  I am also attaching the =
copy of
the invite I found on my computer.  I am sure Alex can do something more
professional looking.



I had to delete a number of potential hosts from last time because they are
serving in the Administration/Government, but we have a probably longer lis=
t
of additional names to add.  Patrick, I left a few names on there that I
think were your people and I don=92t know the status of them now (left your
brother on the list, Nick Baldick, etc.).  This is really just a list of
potential hosts =96 invitees will be longer as I can include the
Administration types.



Alex, do you want to mock up an invite and Patrick, Hunter and I can edit
the list of potential hosts (and update the emails =96 some of which are ou=
t
of date)?



Before we had it at $250 a person.  I say we should do =93hosts - $1200;
Friends - $500; Guest - $250=94 or something like that.



Let me know if you both have any questions.



Best,


Eric
