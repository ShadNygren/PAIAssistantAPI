Joe mentioned last nite that beau or hunt might want Fr Collins on the  
altar. If they do , or anyone else they want , they should have that  
priest call Fr Cini. to speak to him for coordination.  Fr Cini has  
already been in contact w/ Brother Ronald and Fr Szupper - so let him  
know if there are to be more. He said 5/6 on the altar is about max. VBO
