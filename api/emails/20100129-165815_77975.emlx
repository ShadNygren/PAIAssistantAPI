Dear Hunter,
=20
Just a short note to thank you for spending time with us Tuesday evening.
It was indeed a pleasure finally meeting you and to have the chance to
personally thank you for your efforts on our behalf at Bracebridge.
=20
I was extremely interested in your venture capital interest in alternative
energy products.  I would like to connect you with Jim Light=E2=80=99s son Peter,
who is a principal with a company called Bloom Energy, specializing in
alternative energy research and development.  I have obviously known Peter
since birth and am quite perjurative in my opinion of his intelligence and
integrity.  I think you two would at the very least have a stimulating
intellectual exchange.
=20
Finally, we are looking forward to hosting you here at Chechessee Creek Clu=
b
when the Biden men can get it on their schedule. Thanks again for your
meaningful support.
=20
Warmest regards,
Jim
