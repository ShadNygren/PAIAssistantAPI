Marty is doing well, all things considered. He looked a lot better than I
thought he would, and was very much himself. I am sure he would put on a
show anyway-it wouldn't be easy to tell with him if things were bad. But it
did seem like he was doing good and in good spirits. I will hopefully see
him tomorrow-he is going home I think, I asked Kristine if I could drive him
so we'll see. I guess I would say all indications are that he is doing well,
but he did have the cancer, the pathology report came back on Friday, so he
will need chemo and the like and not out of the woods even if it is about as
good as it can be right now.

Subject: Condolences

 

Dear Hunter, 

 

I just wanted to send my condolences to you on the passing of your
grandmother. She was a wonderful, wonderful woman. My grandmothers were the
last to pass of their generation for me and were such important sources of
guidance and history and the kind of strength that can only come from
surviving through all that they did. To think of what they have seen and
done is just amazing. But I know it is very sad. Maybe it is the same for
you; of all my older relatives I was always very close with my dad's mom and
it was a blow when she died even though she was ninety three and was ready
and passed at home. If there is anything I can do, or you want to talk,
please let me know. Please also extend my condolences to your dad and
brother and all of your  family.

 

Sincerely,

 

Art
