Abel-

We are trying to put together a power point that we can use to send to our
potential states in order to get more information on what they can do for
Ormazabal.  This is a helpful powerpoint you send around, but we need to
have a better understanding of the contents of this deck and really need to
have a better understanding of Ormazabal's needs in a U.S. location.  How
large a facility do they need?  How many jobs will be created and when?
What types of access to transportation do they need?  Etc.  In addition, a
primer on Ormazabal and their product line would be helpful.  I know we got
that in our original meeting with Ormazabal, but I don't think everyone was
in that original meeting and I think it would be useful to put in the
powerpoint as well - size of the company, revenues, market share
internationally, etc.  In essence what makes them special.

 What is the best way to get this?  Should we set up a call with you to wal=
k
through the deck you sent or do we need to talk to Ormazabal with you to as=
k
the questions we have?

Let me know your thoughts.

Best,

Eric
