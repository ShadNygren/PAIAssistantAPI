Alex,


I would say the primary focus has been on this part of the Castle statemen=
t:


"I respect Beau Biden's decision to remain focused on his significant resp=
onsibilities as Delaware's Attorney General."

Dear David,
As many of you know, since returning home from Iraq, I have been giving se=

I understand why people care so deeply about this election. The challenges=
 we=E2=80=99re facing as a country are extraordinarily difficult. The econ=

I feel strongly about these issues. However, my first responsibilities are=
 here in Delaware. I have a duty to fulfill as Attorney General =E2=80=93a=
nd the immediate need to focus on a case of great consequence. And that is=
 what I must do. Therefore I cannot and will not run for the United States=
 Senate in 2010. I will run for reelection as Attorney General.
One of the primary reasons I ran for Attorney General was to protect the=
 most vulnerable among us: children. As the father of two young children,=
 I can think of no worse crime than those committed by child predators. It=
 is why one of my first actions and top priorities as Attorney General was=
 the creation of the Child Predator Task Force.
The idea that any child can be a victim of abuse is horrific. The fact tha=
t it has engulfed an entire community is unspeakable. The pain and trauma=
 suffered by the children, their parents, and the families, can=E2=80=99t=
 be measured. But justice can be done. And I am determined to see that it=
 is.
I have a job to finish. And that=E2=80=99s what I must do.
Thank you for all your support,
Beau Biden
