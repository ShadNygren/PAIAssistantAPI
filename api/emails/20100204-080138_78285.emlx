Wade,

Nice to hear from you.
I'm asking Alan Levin, my director of the Economic Development Office, to r=
each out to you.

Thanks a lot.
Jack Markell

Subject: Clean jobs opps at Valero site

Dear Gov. Markell,



Our mutual friend Hunter Biden suggested that I give you a quick email outl=
ine of the green jobs opportunity that we see for the Valero site in Delawa=
re City.



In short, we think the size, systems, permitting, and infrastructure at the=
 site mean that it could become the largest and most important renewable en=
ergy campus in the country, if not the world.



The three key elements are:



1.  Building a 30+ megawatt solar power farm on 100+ acres feeding in to th=
e grid through the existing co-gen power plant on site.  We believe we can =
bring 100% of the financing for this project (minimum $250m investment with=
 400 high-skilled jobs to design/build/tie-in to grid).  It is critical to =
the project's economics that we are "substantially underway" by 12/31/10 fo=
r Treasury Department purposes to qualify us for the ARRA's ITC (Investment=
 Tax Credit).  This would be the largest solar power farm in the country, a=
nd it is possible to expand to make it the world's largest at 75 mw if you =
can help make the necessary land available.



2.  Building a 150,000,000 gallon/year Green Diesel & Green Jet Fuel refine=
ry and distribution hub on the site.  This plant would take advantage of bl=
eeding-edge technology out of a Honeywell division which creates true hydro=
carbon diesel molecules (not methyl esters) from any renewable feedstock.  =
By taking advantage of the infrastructure, permitting, and power sources at=
 the site, we believe that we can bring 2/3 of the capital necessary to com=
plete the project.  Our investment partners are willing to provide us with =
the $100m in operating capital to run the plant, but they are not in the bu=
siness of funding the pre-conversion operations from petroleum diesel to Gr=
een Diesel.  We believe we will need help securing the $40-50m necessary to=
 convert/upgrade/relocate/purchase the necessary equipment.  This $150m inv=
estment would create 100 immediate construction jobs, and would have 100 hi=
gh-paying permanent jobs among trucking, logistics, maintenance, repairs, o=
perations, and shipping.  Obviously we would need to have a flagship corpor=
ate office there as well.



With regard to either a direct investment from Valero as part of their tran=
sition out, or an investment/loan from another public or private entity, it=
 would receive preferred repayment out of operational cash flows.  We model=
 full repayment within 36 months of the plant opening.



3.  Building a pyrolysis oil refinery to feed renewable feedstocks into the=
 existing co-gen power plant.  We believe that there is an effectively infi=
nite opportunity to bring to Delaware any organic feedstock, including all =
organic waste material that otherwise goes to dumps/landfills to convert it=
 to bio-oil through a fast-pyrolysis process.  We would build a bio-oil ref=
inery to convert the feedstock and to connect it to the existing co-gen pla=
nt to burn it for electricity generation.  This provides a very long-term o=
pportunity for Delware to generate renewable electricity bounded only by th=
e amount of bio-mass that can be brought to the site.  The pyrolysis units =
are proven technology with a roughly $30m price tag for each 400 metric ton=
 per day processor.  While our company would seek to fund that project out =
of cash flows from the solar and/or Green Diesel projects, if another inves=
tor were willing to make earlier investments, we would be fully supportive =
either in addition or in substitution for our plans.



In sum, the two immediate project should create 500-700 jobs that would beg=
in as soon as permitting is complete, and bring at least $400m in new inves=
tment to Delaware within 12 months.  The third project would create dozens =
to hundreds of jobs depending on the number of pyrolysis units that were de=
ployed there.



It is worth emphasizing that whatever the eventual outcome of the Blackston=
e negotiations, it would be a tragedy to allow this site to go from one dir=
ty petroleum refinery to a new one without maximizing the job creation and =
clean tech value of the site.  We believe that none of the clean tech plans=
 would interfere with any of the planned petroleum fuel uses.



Please let us know if there are any questions that we can answer.  If you b=
elieve that this project is of interest to you, we would be happy to meet w=
ith you at your convenience.



Best,

/w



p.s., my wife Lorna works for Lenny Mendonca at McKinsey, which I understan=
d from him is helping you in DE.  We'll get him out to DE sometime to swap =
McK war stories sometime soon.
