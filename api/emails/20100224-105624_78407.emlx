To the Parent of:
Finnegan,
Here's What's In The News:

Should we push our children=85.How much?

Introduction by Sara Noon with excerpts from Dr. Ginsburg=92s book Whose=
 Game is it Anyway?

As we head into the heart of lacrosse season, it is so important for we =
as parents to do the pulse check on our parental pressure gauge. Our chi=
ldren might just be starting out with a lacrosse stick in their hands fo=
r the first time, or our children might be going through junior year rec=
ruiting. Either way, we need to understand our children and the level of=
 encouragement and pressure that is right to help them enjoy the sport t=
he most. As parents of child athletes, we are confronted with choices ab=
out how much to encourage and, in some cases, push our children to excel=
 to reach their potential. The challenge is to know when and how to push=
, and when to lighten up.

Before we dive into the chapter from Dr. Richard Ginsburg=92s book Whose=
 Game is it, Anyway?, we are going to start with the end of the chapter =
and take the Parental Pressure Gauge Survey. By taking this first and un=
derstanding how you answer the questions, you will get more help and ins=
ight from the article to follow. This is a no scoring questionnaire; rat=
her its main purpose is to lay a foundation for discussion about the iss=
ue of pressure in sports. We hope that discussing each question will gui=
de parents to explore their own past experiences in sports and bring att=
ention to potential problems.

Education Tip:
Classroom: Double Down
by Lellie Swords and Kari Pabis

Our double-teaming philosophy is to take away the path to goal, then get=
 the ball. If you take away the attacker's path to goal, she has no shot=
=2E If you can force her to pull out and move the ball, it means one les=
s opportunity for the opponent to score. Stay in the double-team until t=
he ball moves or it is dislodged.=20
