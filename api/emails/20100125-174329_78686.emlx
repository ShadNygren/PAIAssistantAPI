Hunter,

Sorry about the earlier email.  I meant to put a question mark in the subje=
ct line.  Either way, a high character and class act move by your brother. =
 I know how important this Bradley case is to him and the state.  Let me kn=
ow how I can be helpful going forward, and I hope we can catch up soon.
