<DIV>Thanks, Chris, exactly right.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Hunter, this could&nbsp;be one of the great public-private partnerships of =
all time if we do it right.&nbsp; There are two key components:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>1.&nbsp; Delaware's Economic Development Department needs to take 25% of =
the $100,000,000 they just got from Valero and loan it back to us to retrofit =
the old oil equipment and make it state of the art Green Diesel =
technology.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>2.&nbsp; We need to get it done in 2010 before the Recovery Act renewable =
energy tax incentives expire for projects like these.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The rest is up to us to make it a profitable enterprise.<BR></DIV>
<DIV>I would expect DE to get its loan repaid within 12 months, though I'd =
certainly set expectations longer than that for safety's sake.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>At the minimum level of investment, we would be able to create 50-100 =
green tech jobs in the short term, and I would expect us to be able to hire =
back almost all of those jobs from the previous plant employees.&nbsp; I would =
also expect that 100% of the retrofit funds would be spent on advanced green =
tech manufacturing equipment made in the USA.&nbsp; We would be able to scale =
up to create as many new jobs as the refinery lost if we were able to find the =
public or private investment for that expansion, or, over time, fund it out of =
profits, which we would be eager to do.&nbsp; Again I would keep that private =
until we are absolutely certain that we can deliver on what we promise.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>For this project,&nbsp;we have reserved a 5.00% equity stake for our =
on-the-ground partners who manage local public affairs issues, and we would =
look to you for guidance on how to deploy that start-up equity.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Last, my partners and I would work for free until the project is =
generating positive cash flow and paying down DE's upgrade investment, so =
there's no risk of it looking like a public subsidy of executives who get =
upside but no downside.<BR></DIV>
<DIV>Let me know what you think and let's do a call shortly if you're =
interested in pursuing the opportunity.</DIV>

a few weeks ago, Wade has been working through the technical and business cases =
on retrofitting and repurposing the Delaware refinery to handle =
biodiesel.<BR><BR>Technical case seems good &#8212; the most experienced =
retrofit company, Triton, thinks it possible and economic; the new equipment =
necessary is made by Honeywell in Illinois (how many DE-IL connections do we =
need!), not rocket science.<BR><BR>Business case also promising, but, and I am =
oversimplifying, there probably needs to be some seed money ($25m?) and this =
needs to happen in 2010 for tax reasons. &nbsp;Interestingly, Valero has =
already paid at least $100m to DE state econ development board &#8212; so there =
may be a DE gov funding source.<BR><BR>Bottom line, I think you and Wade should =
