Dear Hunter,

 

Just a short note to thank you for spending time with us Tuesday evening.
It was indeed a pleasure finally meeting you and to have the chance to
personally thank you for your efforts on our behalf at Bracebridge.  

 

I was extremely interested in your venture capital interest in alternative
energy products.  I would like to connect you with Jim Light's son Peter,
who is a principal with a company called Bloom Energy, specializing in
alternative energy research and development.  I have obviously known Peter
since birth and am quite perjurative in my opinion of his intelligence and
integrity.  I think you two would at the very least have a stimulating
intellectual exchange.

 

Finally, we are looking forward to hosting you here at Chechessee Creek Club
when the Biden men can get it on their schedule.  Thanks again for your
meaningful support.

 

Warmest regards,

Jim
