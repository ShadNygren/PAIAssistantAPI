Ohio State is No. 1 - in president's pay

By Ben Rooney, staff reporter

January 18, 2010: 1:57 PM ET

=20

=20

NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Ohio State University is No. 1 again, but not =
in football or basketball. For the second year in a row, the school's =
president was the highest paid public university executive in the United =
States, according to a study published Monday.

=20

The Chronicle of Higher Education said E. Gordon Gee, Ohio State's =
president, took home $1.6 million last year, up from $1.3 million in =
2008.

=20

Mark Emmert, president of the University of Washington, was the second =
highest paid executive in the survey, with total compensation of more =
than $900,000 last year. Patrick Harker, president of the University of =
Delaware, came in third with more than $810,000 in total income.

=20

The Chronicle, a Washington-based publication focusing on education, =
surveyed total compensation -- defined as salary and benefits -- for top =
executives at 185 public universities..

=20

Gee is the only public university president to have earned more than $1 =
million last year. By contrast, The Chronicle reported in November that =
23 presidents of the nation's top private universities took home more =
than $1 million in 2008, the most recent year surveyed.

=20

In a statement, Gee said leading a public university is "a calling" =
adding that he feels an "unparalleled sense of urgency to fulfill the =
public trust."

=20

"I am fully determined to make good on the University's great promise," =
he said. "We have a limitless capacity to do good in the world, and I =
will tell you that my eye never leaves the ball."

=20

The Chronicle said Gee is one of "a growing number" of presidents that =
have given money back to their institutions, saying he donated $320,850 =
to help endow a scholarship fund.

=20

Meanwhile, the survey found that compensation for public university =
executives overall increased at a much smaller rate in 2009 than in =
recent years. The median total compensation for chief executives last =
year was $436,111, up 2.3% from 2008. After adjusting for inflation, =
however, compensation rose 1.1%.

=20

That compares with total compensation rising between 7.6% and 18.9% each =
year since 2005.

=20

But as the economy soured and many public universities were forced to =
hike tuition and eliminate courses, the issue of executive compensation =
became a sore spot for many schools, said Jeffrey Selingo, editor of The =
Chronicle.

=20

"Steadily rising pay packages of public university chiefs riled parents, =
students and politicians, especially as tuition increases also had been =
hefty from year to year," Selingo said in a statement.

=20

The survey also showed that base salaries stopped growing last year for =
more than one-third of the public university heads, while 10% of them =
experienced a decline in total compensation.

=20

The Chronicle also surveyed compensation at 64 community colleges =
nationwide and identified Eduardo Padr=F3n, president of Miami Dade =
College, as the highest paid.

=20

Padr=F3n's pay package totaled nearly $550,000 last year. He was =
followed by Michael McCall, president of the Kentucky Community College =
and Technical College System, at roughly $532,000. To top of page
