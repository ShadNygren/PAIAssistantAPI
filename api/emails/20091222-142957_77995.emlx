Hi Hunter, a quick reply.

Thank you for reaching out=97we would love to connect with =93Runway to Gre=
en=94 and set up a meeting for you to come to the office also. We have stro=
ng labor roots on our team. It would be a great connection. I am copying my=
 assistant, Wayne Skinner, to help schedule those meetings. I am also copyi=
ng Linnea Hegarty who has  recently joined the Alliance as Development Dire=
ctor.

I spoke to Anna Burger before Copenhagen and we committed to finding time t=
o have lunch with you and Andy Stern to follow up on our lunch conversation=
 early in January.

Happy Holidays to you and your wonderful family as well! We are eager to ha=
ve health care pass, Mark come home to Colorado and celebrate an amazing,ch=
allenging year.

All the best,
Maggie

Maggie-

I hope all is well and you are having a chance to catch up and get some res=
t in Boulder after Copenhagen.   And I hope you get some down time between =
now and New Year=92s to spend with your family.

I just wanted to touch base on a few things and look forward to catching up=
 after the New Year.    I know your office mentioned to my assistant that y=
ou were working on setting up a time in January for me to meet with Andy St=
ern and Anna Burger.  I really appreciate that and look forward to it.  I h=
ave had a number of productive talks since we last met on how to get blue a=
nd green to work together on the financing side for large scale clean energ=
y and infrastructure projects and am excited about the possibilities.   If =
you still think it makes sense I also look forward to coming by your office=
s and talking with the staff members you have who had the background in lab=
or and grassroots.  I think that would be a useful piece to the puzzle.

In addition, I also wanted to see if I could set up a meeting for someone f=
rom =93Runway to Green=94 with the appropriate person on your staff.  =93Ru=
nway to Green=94 is a not-for-profit that grew out of the =93Runway for Cha=
nge=94 organization, which was organized by fashion designers interested in=
 supporting the Obama/Biden campaign.  The founders of Runway to Change hav=
e now dedicated their efforts to starting Runway to Green which will look t=
o get the fashion community more involved in Green issues.  They are lookin=
g for a few environmental organizations to coordinate with and donate the m=
oney they raise to.  I suggested that they talk to your organization as one=
 of the primary beneficiaries.  I think they may also be interested in work=
ing with the Blue/Green Alliance as well.  I know the Runway to Change effo=
rt was very successful and hope that this may be as well.  Not sure if you =
are already doing things with members of the fashion community but it sound=
ed like a good opportunity to possibly expand on that.

I really appreciate everything you have done.  I am cc:ing my assistant Ann=
e Marie so she is looped in on scheduling.

I hope you and Senator Udall have a great Christmas and a Happy New Year. I=
 look forward to catching up after the New Year.

Best,

Hunter
