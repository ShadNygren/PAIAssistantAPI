Alex,


A few suggestions for you and others to consider:


1.  On the copy, I think it's stronger to say "I have a duty to fulfill as=
 Attorney General -- and the immediate need to focus on a case of great co=
nsequence." I know we were worried about making too much of the Bradley ca=
se, but the word "including" seems to me to make too little of it.=20


2.  I'm a little troubled by how political the email looks. I know it's to=
 a list of supporters, but the picture, the slogan, the contribute button,=
 the volunteer button seems too much to me. I would vote for a more minima=
list approach without any of this. If that's too bare bones, I would at le=
ast drop the contribute & volunteer buttons.=20




Thanks.


Mike

So this is what it will look like, barring recommended changes. Ignore the=
 "David," that's just the first name on the list. We also need a subject=
 line -- I threw in "My Duty" because I thought it fit with the theme (plu=
s I like the military undertone). Please send comments by 8am.

I have a job to finish. And that=E2=80=99s what I must do.
