Hunter,

=20

Happy new year! =20

=20

Wanted to give you a heads up that Marc Ecko, Tony and I are going to be
at the Business Forward's Roundtable on Education Innovation with James
Shelton, Assistant Deputy Secretary for Innovation and Improvement, U.S.
Department of Education on Friday in DC.

=20

We will be with Don Moody (full bio below).  Don is the CEO of Word
World that is a 3-D animated PBS series and educational toy line, funded
in part by the US Department of Education (To date $50 million),
encourages preschoolers to become friends with words and get ready to
read.  We are friends with one of his investors and we introduced Marc
to the company.  Marc is on the Board.  We are looking at this as an
investment for ETF too.

=20

We look forward to being helpful to Don in his quest for the "Ready To
Learn" competitive grant in the amount of $200 million (already got $50
million a few years ago).

=20

The meeting is set for Friday, January 8th - 1:00pm - 3:00pm at 1717
Rhode Island Ave. NW, Washington DC 20036

=20

It would be great if you could join us or meet before or afterwards?
Are you free?

DON MOODY

http://www.wordworld.com/presskit/ww_milestones.pdf

Founder, CEO, Word World, LLC; Creator, "WordWorld"
(www.pbskids.org/wordworld)

=20

 When "WordWorld" creator Don Moody discovered his wife was pregnant, he
decided to pursue life differently, most importantly, living by example
and practicing citizenship. Aligning his life with the progression of
his child's life, Moody set out to develop an innovative television show
that addressed children's literacy and taught valuable life lessons.

=20

Based on more than two years of personal research, Moody realized
literacy television shows would be much more effective if words were
brought to life. He remembers thinking "Wouldn't it be cool if the word
'shark' swam off the screen, or if the word 'ice' actually froze in
front of you?" From there, "WordWorld" was born and under Moody's
direction, evolved into an innovative children's show that has received
praise from children, parents and educators alike.=20

=20

Moody's personal history is woven into the "WordWorld" fabric. Moody
grew up with two other siblings  raised by his mother in a single parent
home. Based on his own childhood experience, Moody understands the
importance of introducing effective literacy techniques early to a broad
audience of kids. After his mother moved her family to a better
neighborhood, a creative community helped raise and positively influence
Moody. In fact, many of his childhood friends helped shape "WordWorld's"
ensemble cast of WordFriends(tm).

=20

Prior to creating "WordWorld," Moody founded Moody Communications, a
Manhattan-based advertising agency that serviced a variety of accounts
in entertainment, internet technology, telecommunications, fashion and
investor relations. Moody handled the branding, advertising,
merchandising and licensing business for Jones New York, Verizon and US
Banker, as well as for licensees of Disney, Warner Brothers, Lucas
Films, "Barbie," "South Park," and "Bananas in Pajamas." At the same
time, he independently created, developed and produced "Bobby Blu," an
animated children's property for Wal-Mart, to air as a television series
on the Fox Family Channel. =20

=20

Moody is the recipient of a Graphics Design Award from the Museum of
Modern Art and attended the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan.=20

<p class=3DMsoNormal>Founder, CEO, Word World, LLC; Creator,

<p class=3DMsoNormal>&nbsp;When &#8220;WordWorld&#8221; creator Don =
Moody
discovered his wife was pregnant, he decided to pursue life differently, =
most
importantly, living by example and practicing citizenship. Aligning his =
life
with the progression of his child&#8217;s life, Moody set out to develop =
an
innovative television show that addressed children&#8217;s literacy and =
taught
valuable life lessons.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>Based on more than two years of personal research, =
Moody
realized literacy television shows would be much more effective if words =
were
brought to life. He remembers thinking &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be cool =
if the
word &#8216;shark&#8217; swam off the screen, or if the word =
&#8216;ice&#8217;
actually froze in front of you?&#8221; From there, =
&#8220;WordWorld&#8221; was
born and under Moody&#8217;s direction, evolved into an innovative
children&#8217;s show that has received praise from children, parents =
and
educators alike. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>Moody&#8217;s personal history is woven into the
&#8220;WordWorld&#8221; fabric. Moody grew up with two other siblings
&nbsp;raised by his mother in a single parent home. Based on his own =
childhood
experience, Moody understands the importance of introducing effective =
literacy
techniques early to a broad audience of kids. After his mother moved her =
family
to a better neighborhood, a creative community helped raise and =
positively
influence Moody. In fact, many of his childhood friends helped shape
&#8220;WordWorld&#8217;s&#8221; ensemble cast of =
WordFriends&#8482;.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3DMsoNormal>Prior to creating &#8220;WordWorld,&#8221; Moody =
founded
Moody Communications, a Manhattan-based advertising agency that serviced =
a
variety of accounts in entertainment, internet technology, =
telecommunications,
fashion and investor relations. Moody handled the branding, advertising,
merchandising and licensing business for Jones New York, Verizon and US =
Banker,
as well as for licensees of Disney, Warner Brothers, Lucas Films,
&#8220;Barbie,&#8221; &#8220;South Park,&#8221; and &#8220;Bananas in
Pajamas.&#8221; At the same time, he independently created, developed =
and
produced &#8220;Bobby Blu,&#8221; an animated children's property for =
Wal-Mart,
to air as a television series on the Fox Family Channel.&nbsp; =
