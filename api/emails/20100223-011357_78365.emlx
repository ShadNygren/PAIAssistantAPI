Beau,
I just watched the full video (http://wdel.com/video/?v=bradley.wmv). Your
delivery, and especially your composure, were excellent. Thought that the
timeline (sought indictment, denied kept at it) and the Iraq (watching from
afar) pieces were particularly good additions to a detail-heavy speech.
Great work by the full team on short notice, now we'll see how the coverage
plays.
